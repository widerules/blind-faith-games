The main outcome of the project is the BFG Toolkit, a set of reusable components that facilitate the development of accessible games for blind users in Android. The BFG Toolkit is being developed following an agile, iterative and incremental methodology, building on the analysis of accessibility requirements  of different games.

At the moment 3 games have been developed using the BFG Toolkit: Accesible Minesweeper, Accessible Golf and Zarodnik. All three games are freely available for download from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=e-UCM).

The Applications' source code and the BFG Toolkit can be downloaded from this repository.
