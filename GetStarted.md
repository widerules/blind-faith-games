# Get Started with the BFG Toolkit #

## Prerrequisites ##

If you want to download the code, build and try out BFG Toolkit on your own, you should:

  1. **Install the Java SDK version 1.5 or later.** If necessary, download and install the Java SE Development Kit (JDK) for your platform.
  1. **Install Eclipse.** We recommend you to use Eclipse 3.7.0 or later.
  1. **Install Android SDK and ADT plugin for Eclipse:** If you aren't familiar with Android Development you can read more about it on [Android developers site](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).
    * **Install the Git plugin for Eclipse:** We used the [EGit](http://www.eclipse.org/egit/) project plug-in to download the code from google code git repository. If you are familiar with eclipse, you can directly use the update URL  http://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates to install the plugin.
    * **[Download](http://code.google.com/p/blind-faith-games/downloads/detail?name=BFG%20Toolkit.7z&can=2&q=) and unzip the project**. The BFG Toolkit doesn't have an installer application. All the files you need to run and use it are located in the extracted directory.

In addition, you can [download](http://blind-faith-games.googlecode.com/files/Games.7z) and import all the game projects. Only you have to unzip them on the same folder as the BFG Toolkit.
